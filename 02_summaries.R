# Create area-weighted conversion factor for how many tons of carbon are in each cord.
# Use that to approximate how much carbon is removed with 3000 cords annually (decades)
# Give area-weighted total SCG carbon and change over time (chart) -- with and without removals
# Give area-weighted by cover type (hw, mixed, sw) over time.
